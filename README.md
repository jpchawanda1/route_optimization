# Route Optimization

Developed an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) model in MATLAB to minimize delivery distances by 9.1%, factoring in traffic, weather, & geospatial data.

Cleaned and analyzed Zomato’s Bangalore dataset, revealing key trends (e.g., fog increased delivery times by 30%).

Visualized optimized routes and validated results through 10 simulation runs, ensuring consistency (SD ±3.7 km)

Route Optimization is a Python-based project focused on solving the classical route optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and other logistics and delivery scenarios. The project is designed to provide efficient algorithms, visualization tools, and interfaces for real-world applications in logistics, transportation, and delivery services.

## Features

- **Solvers for TSP and VRP**: Implementations of popular algorithms including brute-force, nearest neighbor, and more advanced heuristics.
- **Customizable Input**: Accepts custom datasets for cities, distances, and vehicles.
- **Visualization**: Plot optimized routes for easy interpretation.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new algorithms or data sources.
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints for integrating optimization into other services (planned/future).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jpchawanda1/route_optimization.git
    cd route_optimization
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line

Run the main script to optimize a route:

```bash
python main.py --input data/cities.csv --algorithm nearest_neighbor
```

### As a Library

```python
from route_optimization.solver import solve_tsp

cities = [
    (0, 0),
    (1, 3),
    (4, 3),
    (6, 1),
    # ... more cities
]
route, distance = solve_tsp(cities, algorithm="nearest_neighbor")
print("Optimal Route:", route)
print("Total Distance:", distance)
```

## Examples

Sample datasets and example notebooks are available in the `examples/` directory.
